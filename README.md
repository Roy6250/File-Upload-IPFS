# File-Upload-IPFS

Managing Patient documents across different Hospital is quiet hassling. This Dapp, Hospital Blockchain Records helps in maintaining Patient's Medical history. 
Only Hospital authority has the priviledge to upload  Medical documents for the patients registered in our system. For storing the files, we have used IPFS, which
is a peer-to-peer distributed system.
